# Grell

Grell is a generic crawler for the web written in Ruby.
It can be used to gather data, test pages in a given domain, etc.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'grell'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install grell

Grell uses PhantomJS, you will need to download and install it in your
system. Check for instructions in http://phantomjs.org/
Grell has been tested with PhantomJS v1.9.x

## Usage


### Crawling an entire site

The main entry point of the library is Grell#start_crawling.
Grell will yield to your code with each page it finds:

```ruby
require 'grell'

crawler = Grell::Crawler.new
crawler.start_crawling('http://www.google.com') do |page|
  puts "yes we crawled #{page.url}"
  puts "status: #{page.status}"
  puts "headers: #{page.headers}"
  puts "body: #{page.body}"
  puts "We crawled it at #{page.timestamp}"
  puts "We found #{page.links.size} links"
  puts "page id and parent_id #{page.id}, #{page.parent_id}"
end

```

### Pages' id

Each page has an unique id, accessed by the property 'id'. Also each page stores the id of the page from which we found this page, accessed by the property 'parent_id'.
The page object generated by accessing the first URL passed to the start_crawling(the root) has a 'parent_id' equal to 'nil' and an 'id' equal to 0.
Using this information it is possible to construct a directed graph.

## Tests

Run the tests with
```ruby
bundle exec rake ci
```
